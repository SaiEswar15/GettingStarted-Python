POINT 1 :
while all the naming convention is lower case in python
we have ordered dictionary from collections 
while importing remeber the naming convention
it goes like 

///from collections import OrderedList (capital O and L)

similarly the counter from collections

///from collections import Counter

POINT 2 :
the join function in python :
most of the operations take func() and parameters 
but the join will be different 

suppose we have list arr = ['a','b','c']

most of the methods use map(function, arr)
but for join method it goes :

joinedString = ''.join(arr)
