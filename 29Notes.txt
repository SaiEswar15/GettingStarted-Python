when we want to print the objects we have to first convert them 
if object {name : "eswar", "age" : 23} is present in the variable details 
inorder to print the object we should use 

print(vars(details)) (or)
print(details.__dict__)

if we want to print the list 
print(list(details))

when ever writing the constructor use 
def __init__():
and also use self keyword 
def __init__(self):

to extend the classes just use ()
class Dogs(Animal)

to use the properties inside the super class 
use super().__init__() inside the constructor
